Simply No Equal in the Component Marketplace ---- Guaranteed!

At Developer Express, we know you have many choices when it comes to acquiring component technologies...
From monolithic packages that promise everything under the sun, to small component libraries that address a very narrow need. 
With so many options available, you might ask yourself why should you consider purchasing a component from Developer Express 
- certainly a component whose name implies only a single control... Well, don't let the name of this suite fool you - 
the XtraGrid Suite, is far more than just a grid control. And even more important, 
if you are committed to delivering top notch features to your customers and want the most capable component 
library of its kind on the market today, you must include the XtraGrid Suite in your development arsenal.

An Evolutionary Leap Forward

Developer Express was the very first component vendor to ship .NET Framework components -
 we were the very first to offer FULL SOURCE CODE to all of our component technologies. 
In several years since we released the first version of the XtraGrid Suite, our focus has 
been to deliver ground-breaking new capabilities for Visual Studio .NET. With XtraGrid Suite, 
you have at your disposal a complete range of UI components specifically designed to give you the necessary flexibility 
and feature-set to deliver solutions that exceed end-user expectation, each and every time.

Uncompromising Capabilities

From cards and carousels to master-detail support...from our shared data editors 
library to ultra fast data loading...The XtraGrid Suite remains unrivaled in the .NET Framework landscape. 
Grids and editors are at the heart of most major applications and choosing the best available library is critical
 to the success of any such project - both in terms of time to market and end user experience.
